## 6. System Architecture

**High-level Architecture Diagram:**
```
[Insert simple diagram showing main components and data flow]

Example:
Frontend (React) <-> API Gateway <-> Backend Services <-> Database
                                   <-> Authentication Service
                                   <-> File Storage
```

**Component Description:**
- **Component 1**: What it does and why it's needed
- **Component 2**: What it does and why it's needed
- **Component 3**: What it does and why it's needed

## 7. Database Design

**Key Entities:**
- **Entity 1**: Fields and relationships
- **Entity 2**: Fields and relationships  
- **Entity 3**: Fields and relationships

**Relationships:**
- How entities relate to each other
- Why this structure supports your features
