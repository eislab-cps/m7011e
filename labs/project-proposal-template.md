## 1. Problem Statement & Solution

**Problem**: [1-2 sentences describing the real-world problem]

**Solution**: [1-2 sentences describing your dynamic web system solution]

**Why Dynamic?**: [Explain how content changes based on user interactions or data]

*Example: Students waste time coordinating study sessions through scattered messages. Our platform provides real-time study group matching that adapts recommendations based on user availability, course enrollment, and collaboration history.*

## 2. Core Features

**Main Features** (4-5 key capabilities):
1. **[Feature]**: [Brief description]
2. **[Feature]**: [Brief description]
3. **[Feature]**: [Brief description]
4. **[Feature]**: [Brief description]

## 3. Target Users

**Primary Users**: [Who will use this system?]

**Key User Journey**: [1-2 sentences showing how a typical user interacts with your system]

## 4. Technology Stack

**Backend**: [Node.js/Python/Go] with [Framework] - *Justification: [Why?]*
**Database**: [PostgreSQL/MongoDB] - *Justification: [Why for your data?]*
**Frontend**: [React/Vue] *(minimal implementation)*

## 5. System Architecture

**Architecture Overview**:
```
[Simple diagram showing main components]
Frontend <-> API <-> Services <-> Database
                 <-> Auth Service
                 <-> [Other Services]
```

**Microservices Plan**:
- **[Service 1]**: [Purpose]
- **[Service 2]**: [Purpose]
- **[Service 3]**: [Purpose]

## 6. Requirements Fulfillment

**Weeks 3-4**: Core features, API implementation, CI/CD pipeline
**Weeks 5-6**: Advanced feature, comprehensive testing, security
**Weeks 7-8**: Documentation, performance analysis, final polish

## 8. Risk Assessment

**Main Risks**:
- **Technical**: [One key risk and mitigation]
- **Scope**: [One key risk and mitigation]

**Fallback Plan**: [Minimum viable features for Grade 3]

## 9. Team Organization
