# Individual Oral Examination Guide

## Overview

Each student will have a **20-30 minute individual oral examination** to demonstrate their personal understanding and knowledge. The grade is based on **individual mastery**, not team performance or feature completeness.

## Examination Structure

### Duration: 20-30 minutes per student
### Format: Individual face-to-face with instructor
### Materials: Whiteboard, access to their code repository

## Assessment Areas

### 1. Code Ownership (25% of oral exam)

**Questions will probe:**
- "Walk me through this function you wrote - explain each line"
- "Why did you choose this approach over alternatives?"
- "What would happen if we changed this parameter?"
- "Show me the tests for this code - what are they actually testing?"

**Grade 5 Student:**
- Explains every design decision with clear rationale
- Discusses alternative approaches they considered
- Can modify code on the spot and predict outcomes
- Understands edge cases and error handling

**Grade 3 Student:**
- Can explain basic functionality they implemented
- Understands the purpose of their code
- Can trace through execution flow
- Knows what their tests validate

**Failing Student:**
- Cannot explain their own code
- Unclear on basic programming concepts
- Cannot trace through simple execution
- Relies on memorized explanations

### 2. System Architecture Understanding (30% of oral exam)

**Typical Tasks:**
- "Draw the complete system architecture on the whiteboard"
- "Explain how a user request flows through your system"
- "What happens when the database goes down?"
- "How would you handle 10x more users?"

**Grade 5 Student:**
- Draws complete system from memory with all connections
- Explains data flow, error handling, and failure modes
- Discusses scaling strategies and trade-offs
- Can compare their architecture with industry patterns

**Grade 3 Student:**
- Can draw their component and its immediate connections
- Understands basic request/response flow
- Knows how their piece fits in the overall system
- Can explain basic database and API interactions

**Failing Student:**
- Cannot draw or explain system architecture
- Confused about component interactions
- Doesn't understand their role in the system
- Cannot explain data flow

### 3. Technology Mastery (25% of oral exam)

**Deep Dive Questions:**
- "Why did you choose PostgreSQL over MongoDB for this use case?"
- "Explain how JWT authentication works - what's in the token?"
- "What's the difference between Docker and Kubernetes?"
- "How does your CI/CD pipeline actually work?"

**Grade 5 Student:**
- Deep understanding of chosen technologies
- Can compare alternatives and explain trade-offs
- Understands underlying principles and limitations
- Keeps up with emerging technologies and trends

**Grade 3 Student:**
- Basic understanding sufficient for implementation
- Knows key concepts of technologies they used
- Can explain why they chose their stack
- Understands fundamental concepts

**Failing Student:**
- Superficial or incorrect understanding
- Cannot explain technology choices
- Relies on tutorials without understanding
- Confused about basic concepts

### 4. Problem Solving & Critical Thinking (20% of oral exam)

**Hypothetical Scenarios:**
- "A user reports the system is slow - how would you investigate?"
- "Your database is running out of disk space - what are your options?"
- "How would you add real-time notifications to your system?"
- "What security vulnerabilities might exist in your implementation?"

**Grade 5 Student:**
- Proposes multiple solutions with trade-offs
- Thinks systematically about problem diagnosis
- Can design solutions for hypothetical requirements
- Discusses emerging trends and innovations

**Grade 3 Student:**
- Can identify obvious issues and suggest basic fixes
- Understands common problems and solutions
- Can think through simple modifications
- Shows basic troubleshooting skills

**Failing Student:**
- Cannot think critically about the system
- No systematic approach to problem-solving
- Cannot propose solutions or improvements
- Lacks understanding of basic issues

## Sample Examination Flow

### Opening (2-3 minutes)
- "Tell me about your role in the team and what you implemented"
- "What was the most challenging part of your implementation?"

### Code Deep Dive (8-10 minutes)
- "Show me the most complex function you wrote"
- "Walk me through your authentication implementation"
- "Explain your database schema design choices"

### Architecture Discussion (8-10 minutes)
- "Draw your system architecture on the whiteboard"
- "Trace a user request from frontend to database and back"
- "What would you change if you had to start over?"

### Technology & Problem Solving (5-7 minutes)
- "Why did you choose your technology stack?"
- "How would you handle [hypothetical scenario]?"
- "What would you add next if you had more time?"

## Red Flags - Automatic Concerns

### Cannot Explain Own Code
- Relies on "I don't remember" for code they wrote
- Cannot trace through execution of their functions
- Unclear on basic programming concepts
- Cannot explain variable names or function purposes

### No System Understanding
- Cannot draw system architecture
- Confused about component interactions
- Doesn't understand request/response flow
- Cannot explain how their code integrates

### Technology Confusion
- Incorrect explanations of basic concepts
- Cannot justify technology choices
- Mixes up similar technologies
- Shows tutorial-level understanding only

### No Critical Thinking
- Cannot propose solutions to problems
- No systematic debugging approach
- Cannot think beyond current implementation
- No curiosity about improvements or alternatives

## Grade Boundaries

### Grade 5 (23-25 points):
- Demonstrates expert-level understanding
- Can teach concepts to others
- Shows innovative thinking and deep knowledge
- Handles all questions with confidence and accuracy

### Grade 4 (18-22 points):
- Shows solid understanding with good explanations
- Can justify most decisions and suggest improvements
- Handles most questions well, minor gaps acceptable
- Demonstrates good engineering thinking

### Grade 3 (13-17 points):
- Basic understanding sufficient for implementation
- Can explain their own work adequately
- Shows fundamental grasp of concepts
- May struggle with deeper questions but shows effort

### Fail (0-12 points):
- Cannot explain their own implementation
- Fundamental misunderstanding of concepts
- No evidence of personal learning or understanding
- Cannot engage meaningfully with technical questions

## Tips for Students

### How to Prepare:
1. **Review your own code** - be able to explain every line you wrote
2. **Understand the big picture** - know how your component fits in the system
3. **Learn the fundamentals** - understand the technologies, not just the syntax
4. **Practice explaining** - can you teach your concepts to a friend?
5. **Think critically** - what would you improve? What are the limitations?

### During the Exam:
- Be honest about what you don't know
- Think out loud when solving problems
- Ask clarifying questions if needed
- Draw diagrams to help explain concepts
- Don't guess - say "I don't know but here's how I would find out"

Remember: The goal is to demonstrate **your personal understanding and growth** as a software engineer.
