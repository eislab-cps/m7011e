- Your personal contributions to the system
- Basic system architecture and data flow
- Technologies used and fundamental concepts
- Security and testing approaches implemented

### Team Grading Based on System Quality

**All team members receive the same grade based on the delivered system:**

- 50%+ test coverage on backend code

#### Grade 4 (Good) - **System Requirements**  
- Previous grade 3 requirements met
- Advanced feature implemented (Option A-E)
- 60%+ test coverage including integration tests and edge cases
- Comprehensive documentation and monitoring

#### Grade 5 (Excellent) - **System Requirements**
- Previous grade 4 requirements met
- Scientific sound evaluation of advanced implementation (options A-E), for example, being able to to demonstrate how the system can be scaled (horizontally/vertically) to handle increased load, demonstrate how the system handles failures and ensures minimal user impact, off line support.
- 70%+ test coverage with end-to-end tests, strategy how to handle edge cases and failure scenarios with mockups/emulators/simulations etc.

TODO: Fix the the text below and 
**Scalability Plan**: Detailed plan for handling 100x current user load
Tasks 1: Implement script/tool that generate traffic to simulate load.
Tasks 2: Document how system can be scaled (horizontally/vertically) to handle increased load.

- **Resiliency Plan**: Evaluate how user experience implication of restarting microservices. 
Task 1: Implement high availability for critical services (e.g., user authentication)
Task 2: Implement script/tool that randomly restart critical microservices to simulate failure.
Task 3: Document how system handles failures and ensures minimal user impact. Can it be done seamlessly wihtout affecting user experience? How can microservices be updated?

## Important Guidelines

### AI-Assisted Development Policy

**AI tools (Claude Code, ChatGPT, Cursor, etc.) are strongly encouraged** for modern software development practices.

#### **Encouraged AI Usage:**
- Code generation and implementation assistance
- Architecture and design pattern suggestions  
- Documentation and comment generation
- Debugging and error resolution
- Test case generation and validation

#### **Your Responsibilities:**
- **Understand everything**: Must explain all design decisions and architectural choices
- **Validate AI output**: Test and verify all AI-generated code thoroughly
- **Document AI interactions**: Maintain log of AI usage and validation process
- **Own the decisions**: You are accountable for all technical choices, regardless of origin

#### **Assessment Focus:**
- **Design reasoning**: Why did you choose this architecture/approach?
- **Alternative evaluation**: What other options did you consider?
- **AI collaboration**: How effectively did you use AI assistance?
- **System understanding**: Can you modify and extend the system?

**Key Principle**: Assessment focuses on your **engineering judgment and system understanding**, not code authorship.

### Academic Integrity
- Work must be original to your team
- Proper attribution for external libraries and resources
- No copying from other student projects
- Collaboration between teams is encouraged, but implementations must be unique
