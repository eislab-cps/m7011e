## Important Guidelines

### AI-Assisted Development Policy

**AI tools (Claude Code, ChatGPT, Cursor, etc.) are strongly encouraged** for modern software development practices.

#### **Encouraged AI Usage:**
- Code generation and implementation assistance
- Architecture and design pattern suggestions  
- Documentation and comment generation
- Debugging and error resolution
- Test case generation and validation

#### **Your Responsibilities:**
- **Understand everything**: Must explain all design decisions and architectural choices
- **Validate AI output**: Test and verify all AI-generated code thoroughly
- **Document AI interactions**: Maintain log of AI usage and validation process
- **Own the decisions**: You are accountable for all technical choices, regardless of origin

#### **Assessment Focus:**
- **Design reasoning**: Why did you choose this architecture/approach?
- **Alternative evaluation**: What other options did you consider?
- **AI collaboration**: How effectively did you use AI assistance?
- **System understanding**: Can you modify and extend the system?

**Key Principle**: Assessment focuses on your **engineering judgment and system understanding**, not code authorship.

### Academic Integrity
- Work must be original to your team
- Proper attribution for external libraries and resources
- No copying from other student projects
- Collaboration between teams is encouraged, but implementations must be unique
