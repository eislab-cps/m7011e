# AI Usage
AI-assisted development is allowed and encouraged to enhance productivity and code quality. However, every team member must fully understand all aspects of the project, including any AI-generated code or suggestions. 

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Any student who cannot explain or justify their code during oral examination will automatically fail, regardless of team performance.

## Personal Commitment Declaration
**I understand that:**
- The oral examination will test my personal understanding, not my ability to use AI.
- I cannot rely on AI assistance during the oral examination.
- I can distinguish between components I implemented versus those implemented by teammates
- I must demonstrate independent technical competency in all areas of the project I contributed to.
- I can explain the purpose and function of every component I implemented.
- I can modify and debug any part of the system I contributed to.
- I understand how my components integrate with the overall system architecture
- I can justify all architectural and implementation decisions.
- I have personally validated all AI-generated code through testing and analysis.
- I take full responsibility for all technical choices, regardless of their origin.

## Technical Competency Self-Assessment
**System Architecture Understanding:**
- [ ] Draw the system architecture from memory.
- [ ] Explain data flow between all components.
- [ ] Justify all technology choices.
- [ ] Identify system bottlenecks and failure points.

**Implementation Competency:**
- [ ] Explain every function I implemented.
- [ ] Debug issues in my code independently.
- [ ] Modify my code for new requirements.
- [ ] Optimize my code for better performance.

**AI Collaboration Skills:**
- [ ] Explain how I validated all AI suggestions.
- [ ] Identify where AI advice was wrong or incomplete.
- [ ] Demonstrate independent problem-solving beyond AI.
- [ ] Show evidence of learning from AI interactions.

**Security and Testing:**
- [ ] Explain all security measures implemented.
- [ ] Justify testing strategy and coverage decisions.
- [ ] Identify potential vulnerabilities in my code.
- [ ] Demonstrate secure coding practices.

## Risk Assessment
**WARNING: Check if any of these apply to you:**
- [ ] I copied AI code without understanding how it works.
- [ ] I cannot explain why certain technical decisions were made.
- [ ] I relied on teammates to understand AI-generated components.
- [ ] I cannot modify or debug AI-assisted code independently.
- [ ] I used AI suggestions without validating them thoroughly.
- [ ] I cannot justify architectural choices during questioning.

**If you checked any box above, you are at high risk of failing the oral examination.**
