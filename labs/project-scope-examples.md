## Red Flags - Scope Too Large:

### Overly Ambitious Ideas:
- "Full social media platform like Facebook"
- "Complete e-commerce system with payment processing"
- "Multi-tenant SaaS with complex billing"
- "Real-time multiplayer games"
- "Machine learning model training platforms"

### Warning Signs:
- More than 8 core features planned
- Integration with 5+ external APIs
- Complex business logic requiring domain expertise
- Features requiring significant frontend complexity
- Real-time features without prior WebSocket experience (for Grade 3-4)

## Scope Adjustment Tips:

### Too Large → Reduce:
- Focus on 1-2 user types instead of multiple personas
- Implement core workflow only, skip edge cases
- Use mock data instead of complex integrations
- Defer admin features to "future work"

### Too Small → Expand:
- Add user roles and permissions
- Implement comprehensive search and filtering
- Add analytics and reporting features
- Include social features (following, sharing)
- Focus on advanced DevOps practices

### Sweet Spot Indicators:
- Can explain entire system architecture in 10 minutes
- Database schema fits on one page
- Core user journey has 3-5 main steps
- API can be tested manually in 30 minutes
- Team feels challenged but not overwhelmed
